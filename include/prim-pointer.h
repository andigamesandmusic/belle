  /**Shared pointer with reference counting for owning and owned object. See
  also the meta::WeakPointer<T> (Pointer<T>::Weak) class for the mutually
  compatible weak pointer form.

  This class replaces traditional pointers T* with Pointer<T> and
  Pointer<T>::Weak. Correct operation is minimally depedent on the user, but
  there are a few rules:

  - A new object must only be assigned once to a Pointer<T>. Pointer<T>'s
  may be freely copied.
  - Raw() should only be used in one of a few circumstances:
    - Crossing a library boundary (third-party library needs the actual pointer)
    - Inspecting the address the pointer points to (for debugging).

  Additionally, the Pointer class is polymorphic and can handle things like:
  \code
  Pointer<Base> B = new Derived;
  Pointer<Derived> D = new Derived;
  B = D;
  \endcode

  It is also much easier to differentiate among derived types. The following:
  \code
  Base* b = ...
  if(Derived1* d1 = dynamic_cast<Derived1*>(b))
    ...
  else if(Derived2* d2 = dynamic_cast<Derived2*>(b))
    ...
  etc.
  \endcode

  Becomes:
  \code
  Pointer<Base> b = ...
  if(Pointer<Derived1> d1 = b)
    ...
  else if(Pointer<Derived2> d2 = b)
    ...
  etc.
  \endcode
